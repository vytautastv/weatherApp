# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

A weather app that lets a user input a country in the search field and be shown key weather metrics to allow them to plan a trip accordingly. 

## App Description

This App will be used to complete the week 8 assignment for the edX front-end web development bootcamp. This app used a number of newly learned skills and functionality such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, APis and more. The weather app will allow a user to to input any country in the search area and be shown key information such as temperature, humidity, wind speeds and includes varied images to showcase the weather of the chosen country. 

The motivation for this app was to test my skills that have be acquired throughout the bootcamp and to create a fully functional app. 

## User Story
